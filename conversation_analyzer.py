                    Example: "Thanks, that worked!" or "Perfect, exactly what I needed"

                    RESOLVED with SOFT resolution:
                    - Customer exits after AI provides complete answer
                    - No follow-up questions after AI's response
                    - No human intervention needed
                    - Customer acknowledges with neutral response like "ok" or "thanks"
                    - No indication of dissatisfaction
                    Example: AI provides information and customer says "thanks" or doesn't respond further

                    - Customer explicitly expresses dissatisfaction
                    - Problem clearly persists after AI's attempt
                    - AI admits it cannot help
